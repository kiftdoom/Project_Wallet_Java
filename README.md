## PROYECT-SWICH-AND-FUNCTION.
### TEAM WORK.
### SIGNATURE: PROGRAMATION 1.
### MEMBERS:
- Chicaiza Jordy.
- Quishpe Frank.
  ### Repository Description:
- This program aims to show us the use of SHWICH and FUNCTIONS through three options that generate processes that contain mathematical operations and the use of arrays.
-  ### What programming languages ​​are used; libraries or third-party packages.:
 Java version 1.8 was used
- ### What was your motivation?
Learn more about functions and Switch through exercises in Java.
- ### Why did you build this project?
To improve my programming logic in addition to applying what I learned in class.
- ### You learned?
We learned new functionalities that provide us with better organization in our learning process.
- ### Project initialization process.
- ### Start. 
You will be presented with a message on the screen to choose 3 options (a, b and c), depending on the option this will solve a different problem.
- ### For option "a".
The user is asked to enter two integer values ​​which will perform the mathematical operation of adding "+". This same one will print our result.
